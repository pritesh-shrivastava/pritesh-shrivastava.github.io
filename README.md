- Are data structures really important for data scientists ?
- No, all engineering streams are not equal : If I got a rank of 1342 again in JEE 21, what colleges and streams would appear on my preference list ? This works fir me, may not be true fir all. But this is what Iâ€™d do if I were an entering freshmen student today, with the benefit of hindsight ofc
- My advice to myself 10 years back as a sophomore in college :
    College is myopic and far from reality.

    No need to feel intimidated about the no of smarter people than you. 

    No need to worry about relationships.

    Real world is different.

    Focus on heavy math courses, some practical cs courses. Ignore management, liberal arts classes. You can learn them on your own from books.

- Spotify dataset - predict song popularity - Indian songs ? from Kaggle's Intro to Deep Learning course tutorials

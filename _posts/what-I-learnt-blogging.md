5 months in, top 5 things I learnt from maintaining a technical blog
(share it just as a LinkedIn / Twitter post with link to the blog, pinned post / tweet around New Year)

- web development and design through static site generators like Jekyll and using Github Pages. Not just HTML/ CSS / JS, but also advanced tips and tricks for Markdown and Latex
- connecting with online communities via Reddit, LinekdIn, Twitter - getting feedback and further ways to improve your understanding
- re-connecting with colleagues and acquaitances over tech matters
- job offers and other opportunties
- keeping you focussed on learning something new tech skills every week, every month + improve your communication skills as a data scietist. forces you to literate programming
- tracking site data on Google Analytics (separate blog?)

If we go back to this notion of a matrix being just an object that transforms space, then eigenvectors are vectors which stay in the same span after that transformation is applied.

Let's look at some examples of matrices, and try and list down their eigen vectors (Quiz 1, Week 5). We'll use the helper script from GWU's free [MOOC](https://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/course-v1:GW+EngComp4+2019/about) to visualize the transormations in a 2-D space.

    - Scaling
    - Rotating
    - Sheer

Also, looking at the inverse matrices, we can calculate inverse matrices by hand. For eg, if we apply a shear through a 2x2 matrix like this, ...
it's inverse will be ...

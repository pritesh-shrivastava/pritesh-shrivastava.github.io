I’m not super enthusiastic about Kaggle medals anymore. Could be a case of grapes are sour but I’ve decided to take chill pill.

I came close to solo bronze finish a couple of times only to lose by a few spots.

I find Kaggle learn a really underrated resource on Kaggle. Competitions- maybe I’ll team up and try abs do better. My lessons learnt were that my local cross val was not marching the public leaderboard.

Naval Ravikant says the winners of any game are ones whose marginal utility of playing game is zero or negative yet they keep doing it while others move on. This is something I can relate because I kept worrying about my school grades to an insane limit. That constant need to top the exams went away only after sophomore year at college.

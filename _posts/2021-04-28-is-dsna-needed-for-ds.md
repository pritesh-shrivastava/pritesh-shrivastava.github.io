Leetcode grinding sounds depressing. Similarly hacker rank and hacker earth coding puzzles.
Subreddits about this topic are even more depressing 
Looking at how many months people grind on these programming puzzles just to get a FAANG job is just not a very attractive prospect 

MOOCs-
Stanford, Princeton, UCSD 
Many books on algorithms like cormen, knuth which take years? To read
Why ???

I even took a CS elective in college about data structures and algorithms and found the subject so dry and abstract that I dropped out of the CS minor.

Instead of going down this mundane route, I thought if I have to do this, I might as well enjoy the process. So I started reading sicp.
Also took the prog Lang mooc to be clear about various programming paradigms and understood difference between fp abd oop, static and dynamic typing. 
Grokking algorithms book is pretty good.

Go to workera -> different roles different needs

Now companies have stopped asking Algo questions in coding round slowly and instead ask ml case studies. Trend is changing slowly.

CS people know these very well so they ask Algo to everyone!!

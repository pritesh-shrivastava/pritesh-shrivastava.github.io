#### Does Leetcode grinding make you a better data scientist ?

Nope. 
My opinion may change later, but as of today, I hardly see any benefit in doing that.

I had posted this question on [Kaggle forum](https://www.kaggle.com/questions-and-answers/225859) as well, and I'm still not convinced by the arguments made by people who supported Leetcoding for data science roles.

Honestly, Leetcode grinding (OR HackerRank OR HackerEarth) just seems depressing. Go visit a  
subreddits about this topic and you'll be overwhlemed to know about these Leetcode jockeys. The reason it's become so common is because of the interview patters of "FAANG" companies.

I'm not particularly against this subject area though. Data Structures and Algorithms is actually a very interesting and intellectually stimulating topic. But if the only reason you're studying this topic is to crack a FAANG interview, then you'll find it dry, abstract and meaningless.

The good news is that some companies have stopped asking DS/Algorithm questions, and instead ask about ML case studies in the coding round. I'm hopeful this trend will catch up fast.

I'm bored of data science now. 

Data scientists are wannabe software developers.

Most data science jobs are just rebranded "Business Analyst" / "Data Analyst" roles.

AI can never become conscious.

Most Data Science teams have negative ROI for business.

Very few "data science" jobs need ML.

Data science is just a shorter & cheaper MBA.

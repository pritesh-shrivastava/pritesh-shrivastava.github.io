I maintain a list of my yearly goals on Trello, and before archiving my old lists from 3 years back, I found it interesting to revisit some of these courses I took up back then as a beginner level data scientist. I was working at a startup back then and had to figure out many things on my own.

- Data Visualization with Tableau

(https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-visualization) I know GUI is for wimps, but if, like me, you come from a non CS background, tools like Tableau make it very easy for you to productionize your analysis and distribute it easily with your team without much coding efforts. The course was good, but more importantly, they also gave 2 Tableau Desktop licenses for a period of 6 months on Coursera!


- ML with Tensorflow on GCP - Started back then, finished much later. Fairly practical and useful.
- Deep Learning Specialization - took the 1st course of the specialization then. I finished the entire specialization over a period of 1.5 years with fair bit of spacing between these courses as I found them to be fairly heavy.


Okayish
- JHU - Data Sceince specializtion. Did not complete it the 10 course specialization!
- Intro to MongoDB (https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-mongodb)
- SQL for Data Science (https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science)


Some forgettable courses that I wouldn't recommend!! : 
- [Introduction to Python for Data Science](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT208x+3T2018/home)
- Linked In Learning / Lynda - just a playlist of videos, fairly short duration, not much exercises or projects


It was also around that time that I started using Kaggle properly, moved from the default Novice tier to a Contributor, strted getting involved in Discussions and some competitions as well. I also started using Github for my personal projects, try and contribute to OSS.

Overall, it was mostly introductory level stuff. I ended up spending some time on some fairly ordinary courses that I would never go back to now. But back then, they still served a purpose to keep me busy / motivated while there was not much quality content back then / the wareness was limited. Still, keep dooimg the small things. They always add up. The growth is never linear. It's more like compound interest.

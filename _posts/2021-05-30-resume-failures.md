This month, I joined my dream company Microsoft as a Senior Data Sceintist in the Web Defense team. Instead of just announcing my recent achievements of getting my dream job at Microsoft, I thought I should share some failures too. We take our achievements too seriously on LinkedIn.  So I decided to write about my list of failures in a 1 page resume format. 


But of course you can’t just talk about failures alone. To make the story complete, the failures need to be followed by some success as well. Otherwise you’ll just be seen as a loser.


Education:
Schooling-
Failed in mathematics exam in KG-II
Failed to participate in extra curricular activities 

Undergraduate -
CPI reduced from 9.5 to 8.7 from 1st to 4th year
Dropped minor in CS and Management 

EY -
Did not get 4.5 / 5 star rating in performance review 
Did not get promoted in 2 years 

Avanti -
Failed to scale the DS team
Failed to deploy > 60% of my ML models in production 

Tests and scores -
Application rejected by IIMs or ISB 

Hobbies -
Left hobbies of guitar, kickboxing


I find it easier to write about failures which are very old, but I’m still uncomfortable to talk about the more recent ones. I can’t go on and talk about my more recent failures. Maybe the sting has not gone out yet.

#### Why bother ?

I've observed a major change in my perspective in the last few months. 
After gettign so much time during WFH in the last almost 2 years, I got time to spend on reading more than ever.
I started reading Mindfulness in Plain English by Bhante Gunratne during this time. 
I did complete a 10-day Vipassana course a few years back but didn't really continue the daily practise.
In the last few months, I tried to go back to practising Vipassana meditation.
At the same time, I also began reading about Vedanta, starting with Vivekanada's books.
Advaita Vedanta & Buddhist philosophy seem to be like mirror images of each other. 
One talking about non duality while the other talks about emptiness.

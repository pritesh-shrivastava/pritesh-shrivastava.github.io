Online course by one of my favourite sports writers - Jarrod Kimber.
I paid for the course.

Bring your passion into your writing.

Sports writing should move you like how sport moves you.

Parallels to tech writing - I loved Paul Graham's essays. The inspire you to get up and code, build a startup, Peter Norvig is good. Andreesen Horrowitz is okay. Vicky Boykis has interesting takes on current affairs. Hadley Wickham's writing is very clear and persuasive. 

Why sport matters to you - 
- relation to physics - swing of the ball, reverse swing. That ball from Irfan Pathan to Adam Gilchrist in India's tour of Australia 2004. The banana swing of Pathan & Balaji in India's tour of Pakistan 2004.
- The underdog story - 
    Ashraful taking Bangladesh to victory against Aus in a tri-series at England, chasing 251, in 2005.
    India defending a target of 120 against Aus in Mumbai in a Test match
    Sreesanth hitting Andre Nel for a 6 after he was sledging him in SA
- The players, role models
    Rahul Dravid with his tight stance, patience, square cuts, consistency in 2000s
    Brendom McCullum and the revival of NZ Cricket team in the 2015 CWC. Giving his all for the team. Always attack plan
    2016 WT20 Ind v Aus, Kohli in the quarterfinal in Mohali finishing the game
    Dhoni sneaking games against Ban in WT20 2016. DK in Nidahas Trophy
- I've played the sport personally mostly with my brother, with my college friends, work colleagues.
    I love bowling. I also like playing drives on the off side in a traditional batting style
    I do off spin, maybe off cutters, bowl medium fast. Love getting clean bowls.
- The tactics and strategies of Test match cricket. Watched India's tour of SA, Aus & Eng in 2018. Loved the small game plays to delay the game, using old ball, working with time, being patient.

Favourite Players:
- When did I first notice them ?
    Rahul Dravid -  When he was bowled out for 99 by Shoaib Akhtar and he was visibly angry with himself, Ind tour of Pak 2004
    MSD when he scored that 148 against SL in 2006
    Kohli, 2016, in WT20 & IPL, looking at his fitness level and dedication to the sport, his diet and machine like lifestyle

- Have you ever seen them live ?
    MSD, yes, in a CSK match, but not up close.
    Kohli, at Wankhede when he made 235 against Eng, and the stadium had erupted. Though he got out shortly afterwards

- What is it about them that you love?
    Dravid - gentleman, silent, sober, selfless, smart, humble, hard working
    he willed his success even though he wasn't as talented as Sachin
    MS - wily, calm, cool, winning those pressure moments, funny during press interviews
    Kohli - hard working, passion, dedication, ambition to be the No 1 in Tests

- What are their flaws?
    MS - not a test match player. Could optimize for constraints but create long form strategies
    Dravid - could not play aggressively regularly even though he made a 50 off 20 balls once
    Kohli - impulsive thinker, not a great captain

- How do they do what they do ?
    Dravid - Hard work
    Kohli - Hard work
    MSD - By thinking without being under pressure. He is an old soul. He has been here before.

- What do they remind you of?
    Dravid - old school manners, respect, integrity
    Kohli - ambition, dedication
    MS - trustworthiness

- How have they been a part of your life?
    Role models for much of my adult life
    How to set goals and work towards acheiving them
    How to handle success and failure
    How to inspire others, your team

- What does it feel like when they fail / succeed ?
    Pride for India
    MS in the later part was abused a lot for overstaying but I wanted him to win that semifinal match against NZ
    Rahul Dravid - vindication for simple men, nerds

- Why do they matter to you ?
    will always remain role models
    great memories from India winning WC and other series and tournaments to some heartbreaking losses that made me cry
    part of my childhood and adulthood
    I was able to distract myself from my breakups because of them. They helped me escape.
    Cope from my sad life. Whenever life was tough, these heroes showed me you can still win from any situation, to never give up, keep fighting, play for the long haul.
    Life is like a Test match, have patience & Your place will be remembered in history

This post is fairly meta, but I just wanted to pin point my motivations for working as a data scientist.

There are some obviuous pros to it - 
- money
- new and interesting opportunities coming up everyday
- people will perceive you as cool or intelligent

But these are all external factors. They are outside of my control. Maybe 2 years later, the hype will die down.

So what part of it do I enjoy about my current job ?

To answer this question, I wanted to understand what are some other activities or moments where I was truly happy that I really enjoy, excluding purely pleasure 
- I remember solving classical mechanics problems from high school physics
- long distance running out in the nature
- swimming alone by myself

What's common in all these activities is the single minded focus on the present moment. In fact, it's a very well established fact from the practise of meditation. When your mind is free of thoughts, it's in pure bliss. But that state is very difficult to acheive. What you can try to do is to try and focus your mind on just 1 thing at a time, and free it from all other distractions. If you're able to acheive this very rare state, you are in what people call "Deep Work" or "programming zen" "in the zone" or "runner's high". It's when you're optimally engages with the problem at hand, you're neither bored, nor anxious. 

And I've found that data science as a feild offers me fair bit of opportunities to explore this state. Ofcourse it happens very rarely. Sometimes, it could be about a clever bit of programming, or sometimes it could be about building on some mathematical model, but it offers enough of an intellectual challenge that can force you to immerse yourself wth the problem at hand. And that's what keeps me going, trying to search for those moments. They may not come every day or every week. You may not even know when it's happening, but once that moment has passed is when you feel very accomplished, fortunate, thrilled / grateful.

As long as I keep finding those moments, I'll be fine with this choice of career. If or when it stops happening, I'll have to figure out what it is now that can push me towards zen

I'm so glad that data science is not the "hottest" job anymore. 
Thank you blockchain and cryptocurrencies!

In the past couple of years, we've seen hundreds, if not thousands, of training academies prop up in the ed-tech space claiming to teach you data science in 2 weeks / 2 months / 6 months. Because of the high demand from students and beginner data scientists, these businesses have been booming so far but they've also setup unreal expectations for their students. 

I've been working in this field for about 5 years now, and I would consider myself far from being an expert. But don't take my word for it. Listen to Francois Chollet, the creator of on of the most popular DL libraries, Keras - 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don&#39;t consider myself a deep learning expert by any means. There are still a lot more things I don&#39;t know than things I know (it&#39;s not even close). I&#39;ve only been working with neural networks since 2009, which is a lot less than many of you.</p>&mdash; François Chollet (@fchollet) <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1386369978220253190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Besides, I&#39;m not sure that &quot;deep learning experts&quot; exist. People with the highest h-index can&#39;t write a GPU kernel or design a DL ASIC. Nor could they win a Kaggle competition. Nor, for the most part, write reusable code (which is really the core of DL).</p>&mdash; François Chollet (@fchollet) <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1386370113809522690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only that, but when I chat with experts, I&#39;m often surprised by how few of them seem to have a clear mental model of what DL is and how it works. In fact, many big-name researchers often say things that are manifestly untrue and easy to disprove!</p>&mdash; François Chollet (@fchollet) <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1386370359016890370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If someone tells you they&#39;re a top expert, a pioneer, the main thing they&#39;re an expert at is playing status games. The same people will probably also try to demean those they feel are in competition with them, because that&#39;s how status games work.</p>&mdash; François Chollet (@fchollet) <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1386371194870398976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 


Peter Norvig, who works as the Director of Research at Google, wrote a beautiful essay titled [Teach Yourself Programming in 10 Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html). Data science is no exception. 

This philosophy is what some people call the "craftsman" mindset. Such kind of roles or careers are best suited to people who enjoy doing ["deep work"](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692). I must also admit that such flow states arising from deep work are few and far between.

With time, I hope this hype around AI settles down, and both job seekers AND employers have a more clear expectation about the data scientist roles. As for me, I've enjoyed working in this space for the most part. There is still so much I WANT to learn, and then some more, that I NEED to learn. This was also a major motivating factor for me to start writing this blog. Something that will push me to share what I'm learning regularly, something that I will continue to do in the next few years.

However, it has a deeper meaning revolving around the emotional transformation of the narrator. The narrator is shown to be aloof and emotionally distant in the beginning. But through his interactions with Astafy, he seems to have developed empathy for human emotions, which leads to him narrating the story. Otherwise, there would have been no point in introducing the short plot before Astafy and Emelyan's story. I think the author wanted to imply that Astafy was able to change narrator's heart and bring him out of his shell. The narrator has been living alone for years which has made emotionally numb. However, the story of Astafy did something to the narrator which made him tell us the story. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Hi there, I'm Pritesh!
I'm _currently_ working as a data scientist. This blog is kind of a journal about my learnings.
So I'll try to focus on technology, programming, data science, AI...
Though I might meander along some tangents every now & then.


Once upon a time, I used to solve data science problems on 
competitive platforms like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/priteshshrivastava">Kaggle</a>, and was fairly active on <a href="https://github.com/pritesh-shrivastava">Github</a>.

If you want to connect with me, you can reach out on one of my social media handles listed on the sidebar. 
You can also book a 1:1 connect with me on [topmate](topmate.io/pritesh_shrivastava) for any kind of mentoring or career guidance.

This website is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> & Github Pages, 
which were surprisingly pretty simple to use. The theme is  
<a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a>, which is free and compatible with Github Pages as a remote theme. To know more about these tools, check out this great 
<a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">guide</a>.
